## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was lacking in handling images so I understand this now & managed to make this.

### Continued development

I need to learn more about Flexbox & start more exploring it. This is a basic design so, further developments are not that possible.

### Useful resources

- I used some website to find exact box shadow that is in design
